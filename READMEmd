# This is my first animated website wherein I used some of the core development languages.
Pre-requisites to build  this wonderfull website and add confidence to oneself:
* one must have a good grasp over 3 pillars of development i.e. Html CSS and JavaScript.
* one should also have the knowledge of GSAP in order to add minimal touches in website.
